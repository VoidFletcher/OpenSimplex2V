# OpenSimplex2V Sample: 3D Noise Benchmark

This sample demonstrates how to:

- Generate 3D noise using OpenSimplex2V
- Use Unity Jobs and Burst for high-throughput noise evaluation
- Log time per sample and MSamples/s
- Instantiate noise logic via `NoiseBehaviour`

To use:
1. Import the sample from Package Manager
2. Drag `NoiseExample.prefab` into your scene
3. Press Play and observe console logs
